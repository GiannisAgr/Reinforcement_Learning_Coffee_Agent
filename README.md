# Reinforcement Learning Coffee Agent

# <sub><sub>Got tired waiting above your Moka pot getting anxious over your esspresso exploding to the universe.
  You would like to have a personal barista but cant afford it.<sub><sub>

# <sub><sub>Say no more!<sub><sub>

# <sub><sub>We can achieve that with the use of reinforcment learning.
  In this project i built an agent to do just that.<sub><sub>

# <sub><sub>I trained my agent to open and close the stove to achieve optimal temperature, in theory at least, 
  (yeah i wanted a robot too).<sub><sub>

# <sub><sub>Thanks for reading, see you at the top.<sub><sub>
