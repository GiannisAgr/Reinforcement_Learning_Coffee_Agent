# Reinforcement Learning Coffee Agent

# Got tired waiting above your Moka pot getting anxious over your esspresso exploding to the universe.
# You would like to have a personal barista but cant afford it.

# Say no more

# We can achieve that with the use of reinforcment learning

# In this project i built an agent to do just that

# I trained my agent to open and close the stove to achieve optimal temperature, in theory at least, (yeah i wanted a robot too)

# Thanks for reading, see you at the top.
